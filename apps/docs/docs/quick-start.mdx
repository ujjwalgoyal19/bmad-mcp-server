# Quick Start - 5 Minutes to BMAD MCP

<Info>
  **Goal**: Have a working BMAD MCP instance with multi-project context
  management in 5 minutes.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

<Check>**Bun Runtime**: Modern JavaScript runtime (faster than Node.js)</Check>

<Check>**Git**: Version control system</Check>

<Check>**Docker**: For local development infrastructure</Check>

```bash
# Check if you have the prerequisites
bun --version  # Should show version 1.x.x
git --version  # Should show version 2.x.x
docker --version  # Should show version 20.x.x
```

## Step 1: Clone and Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ujjwalgoyal19/bmad-mcp-server.git
cd bmad-mcp-server

# Install dependencies (Bun is fast!)
bun install

# Start the development infrastructure
bun run compose:up
```

<Note>
  The `compose:up` command starts PostgreSQL, MinIO, Redis, and Qdrant in Docker
  containers. This provides the complete infrastructure for BMAD MCP.
</Note>

## Step 2: First Project Setup (1 minute)

```bash
# Run the CLI in development mode
bun run dev:cli

# Inside the CLI, create your first project
create-project "My Awesome Project" "Building a revolutionary app"
```

<Tip>
  The CLI provides an interactive experience. Use arrow keys to navigate and
  Enter to select options.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Add Context and Test (2 minutes)

```bash
# Add some context to your project
add-resource "API Design" "RESTful API with GraphQL integration"
add-resource "Database Schema" "PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM"
add-resource "Frontend Stack" "Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind"

# Test context retrieval
query-context "How should I structure my API?"
```

## Step 4: Multi-Project Orchestration

```bash
# Create a second project
create-project "Mobile App" "React Native companion app"

# Switch between projects seamlessly
switch-project "My Awesome Project"
switch-project "Mobile App"

# Context is automatically managed per project
query-context "What's my mobile app architecture?"
```

## CLI Commands Reference

| Command          | Description             | Example                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `create-project` | Create a new project    | `create-project "Name" "Description"` |
| `list-projects`  | List all projects       | `list-projects`                       |
| `switch-project` | Switch active project   | `switch-project "Project Name"`       |
| `add-resource`   | Add context resource    | `add-resource "Title" "Content"`      |
| `query-context`  | Search project context  | `query-context "your question"`       |
| `show-context`   | Display current context | `show-context`                        |

## WebSocket Server (Optional)

For real-time orchestration, start the WebSocket server:

```bash
# In a new terminal
bun run dev:ws

# The server will be available at ws://localhost:8080
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use?**

```bash
# Kill processes using ports 5432, 9000, 8080
bun run compose:down
bun run compose:up
```

**Database connection failed?**

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Restart infrastructure
bun run compose:down && bun run compose:up
```

**CLI not responding?**

```bash
# Restart the CLI
Ctrl+C to exit, then run: bun run dev:cli
```

## Performance Expectations

- **Startup Time**: < 30 seconds for full infrastructure
- **Query Response**: < 100ms for context retrieval
- **Project Switching**: Instantaneous
- **Memory Usage**: ~200MB for development setup
