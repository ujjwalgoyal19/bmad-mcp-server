# Interactive Demo & Examples

<Warning>
  **Live Demo**: Copy-paste these examples to experience BMAD MCP's context
  management capabilities firsthand.
</Warning>

## Demo Setup

First, ensure you have BMAD MCP running:

```bash
# Start the infrastructure
bun run compose:up

# Start the CLI
bun run dev:cli
```

## Example 1: Multi-Project Context Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI Commands">
    ```bash
    # Create two different projects
    create-project "E-commerce Platform" "Full-stack e-commerce with React & Node.js"
    create-project "Mobile Fitness App" "React Native fitness tracking application"

    # Add context to first project
    switch-project "E-commerce Platform"
    add-resource "Tech Stack" "Frontend: React, Backend: Node.js, Database: PostgreSQL"
    add-resource "API Design" "RESTful APIs with GraphQL for product catalog"
    add-resource "Authentication" "JWT tokens with refresh mechanism"

    # Switch to second project
    switch-project "Mobile Fitness App"
    add-resource "Tech Stack" "React Native, Redux, SQLite"
    add-resource "Features" "Workout tracking, progress analytics, social features"
    add-resource "API Integration" "REST APIs for data synchronization"

    # Query context from current project
    query-context "What's my authentication strategy?"
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Expected Output">
    ```bash
    BMAD MCP> create-project "E-commerce Platform" "Full-stack e-commerce with React & Node.js"
    ✅ Project "E-commerce Platform" created successfully

    BMAD MCP> switch-project "E-commerce Platform"
    🔄 Switched to project: E-commerce Platform

    BMAD MCP> query-context "What's my authentication strategy?"
    Based on your project context:
    - JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
    - Integrated with PostgreSQL backend
    - RESTful API authentication endpoints
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example 2: Context-Aware AI Responses

```bash
# Add comprehensive project context
add-resource "User Management" "User registration, profiles, preferences"
add-resource "Payment Integration" "Stripe payment processing, webhooks"
add-resource "Deployment" "Docker containers, AWS ECS, CI/CD pipeline"

# Ask context-aware questions
query-context "How should I implement user authentication?"
query-context "What's my deployment strategy?"
query-context "How do payments integrate with user accounts?"
```

## Example 3: Real-time Collaboration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Terminal 1 - Developer A">
    ```bash
    # Developer A working on API design
    switch-project "E-commerce Platform"
    add-resource "API Routes" "/api/products, /api/orders, /api/users"
    add-resource "Data Models" "Product, Order, User, Cart schemas"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Terminal 2 - Developer B">
    ```bash
    # Developer B sees real-time updates
    switch-project "E-commerce Platform"
    query-context "What API routes are available?"
    # Instantly sees Developer A's additions
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example 4: Semantic Search Capabilities

```bash
# Add various types of context
add-resource "Error Handling" "Global error boundaries, logging, monitoring"
add-resource "Performance" "Caching strategies, database optimization"
add-resource "Security" "Input validation, XSS protection, CSRF tokens"

# Semantic search finds relevant information
query-context "How do I handle errors in my application?"
query-context "What security measures should I implement?"
query-context "How can I improve performance?"
```

## Advanced Examples

### Large Codebase Management

```bash
# Simulate a large project with multiple modules
add-resource "Frontend Module" "React components, state management, routing"
add-resource "Backend Module" "Express server, middleware, database models"
add-resource "Infrastructure" "Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, logging"

# Context-aware development
query-context "How does the frontend communicate with the backend?"
query-context "What's the deployment pipeline?"
```

### Multi-tenant Architecture

```bash
# Different client contexts
create-project "Client A - SaaS Platform" "Multi-tenant SaaS application"
create-project "Client B - Mobile App" "Native mobile application"

# Client-specific context
switch-project "Client A - SaaS Platform"
add-resource "Tenant Isolation" "Database schemas, API keys, resource limits"
add-resource "Billing Integration" "Subscription management, usage tracking"

switch-project "Client B - Mobile App"
add-resource "Mobile Optimization" "Offline sync, push notifications, app store deployment"
```

## WebSocket Real-time Demo

```bash
# Start WebSocket server for real-time features
bun run dev:ws

# In another terminal, connect via WebSocket
# The server provides real-time context updates
# Try modifying context and see live updates
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Test BMAD MCP's scalability:

```bash
# Create multiple projects quickly
for i in {1..10}; do
  create-project "Project $i" "Test project $i"
done

# Add bulk context
add-resource "Bulk Test" "Testing scalability with large datasets"

# Query performance
time query-context "performance test"
```

## Integration Examples

### With Popular AI Tools

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub Copilot">
    ```bash
    # BMAD MCP provides context for Copilot
    switch-project "E-commerce Platform"
    query-context "Generate a product API endpoint"

    # Copilot gets full project context
    # Results in more accurate, context-aware code
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ChatGPT/Claude">
    ```bash
    # Export context for external AI tools
    export-context --format json > project-context.json

    # Use with any AI tool for better responses
    # Context includes tech stack, architecture, requirements
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting Demo

```bash
# Test error handling
query-context "nonexistent topic"
# Should gracefully handle missing context

# Test recovery
add-resource "Recovery Test" "Testing error recovery mechanisms"
query-context "recovery test"
```
