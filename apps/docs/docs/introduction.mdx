# Scale AI Context Management Across Any Number of Projects

<Info>
  **BMAD MCP** transforms how developers orchestrate AI context across multiple
  projects, providing the flexibility and robustness needed for modern
  development workflows.
</Info>

## The Context Management Crisis

Traditional AI tools struggle with context management across multiple projects:

- **Fragmented Context**: Each project maintains its own isolated context
- **Inconsistent Outputs**: AI responses vary based on limited project scope
- **Manual Orchestration**: Developers manually switch between project contexts
- **Scalability Limits**: Fixed context windows restrict project complexity
