# Contributing — BMAD MCP Server

Welcome — thank you for contributing. This page outlines how to get started, report issues, and submit PRs.

## Getting started

- Fork the repo and create a branch named using the pattern: `feat/<area>-short-description` or `fix/<area>-short-description`.

## Code of conduct

- Be respectful. Engage constructively. Follow standard open-source conduct.

## Development process

- Make small, focused PRs. Include tests for new behavior.
- Keep public APIs (ports and Ctx shape) stable; if changing them, include migration notes and update all consumers.

## Commit messages & branch naming

- Use concise present-tense commit messages. Prefix with scope where helpful: `mcp-core: add validation to saveTextResource`.

## Pull request guidelines

- Open a PR against `master` (or the repository's main branch). Include a description, testing notes, and link related issues.
- PR reviewers will check for: passing CI, meaningful tests, clear changelog entry, and adherence to style rules.

## Issue reporting

- Provide a minimal reproduction, environment, and expected vs actual behavior.

## Testing requirements

- Unit tests required for logic changes in `mcp-core`.
- Adapter changes should include both unit tests and a small integration test when possible.

## Documentation

- Update `apps/docs/` and the top-level docs (README, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, API_REFERENCE.md) when behavior or APIs change.

## Release & versioning (maintainers)

- Releases are managed by maintainers. Tag releases in Git and update changelogs where appropriate.

## Community resources

- For questions, open an issue or reach out to maintainers in the project repository.
